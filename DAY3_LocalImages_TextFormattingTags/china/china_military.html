<P>The Army is the land branch of the ROC Armed Forces tasked with defending Taiwan and its offshore islands.[45] Because of the historical legacy of having once controlled mainland China, the Army has traditionally been the dominant branch of the ROC's military forces,[46] has the largest number of personnel,[30] but it has received the biggest reduction in size from the military reforms of the 1990s.[34] Also part of the reform was changing Army divisions into smaller and more mobile combined arms brigades.[30] In recent years, with the reduction of conscription, it has been reported that Army brigades may only have 60% to 80% of the soldiers they require.[47] The Army has several hundred tanks, some from the U.S. and some locally made, though all of them are many decades old.[48]

    In 2015, the Army was organized into 3 army corps, 5 infantry brigades, 3 mechanized infantry brigades, 4 armored brigades, 3 aviation brigades, and 5 artillery brigades, with a total of 1,100 tanks and 1,600 artillery pieces.[49] The number of infantry brigades was gradually reduced from 25 in 2005 to 5 by 2016 and the number of armored brigades from 5 to 4 in 2010, while artillery brigades were increased and army aviation brigades were established in 2015.[50] Also in 2015, the Army's total personnel was reported at 150,000.[42] In 2023 it had 94,000 soldiers.[2</P>
