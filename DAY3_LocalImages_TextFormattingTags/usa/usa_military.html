    <p>The U.S. Armed Forces are one of the world's largest military forces in terms of personnel. 
        They draw their personnel from a large pool of professional volunteers. The U.S.
         has used military conscription, but not since 1973. 
         The Selective Service System retains the power to conscript males,
          requiring the registration of all male citizens and residents living in the U.S. between the ages of 18 and 25.</p>
