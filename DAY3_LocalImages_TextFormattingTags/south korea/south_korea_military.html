    <p>The South Korean armed forces remained largely constabulary forces until the outbreak of the Korean War on June 25, 1950, requiring the United Nations to intervene with United States-led forces.
         The South Korean military rapidly developed during the Korean War, despite suffering enormous casualties. 
         As the Soviets had armed North Korea, the U.S. armed and trained the South Korean military throughout the Korean War. 
         After the Korean War, South Korea established a joint military partnership with the United States, termed the ROK-U.S. 
         Alliance,[6] as outlined by the Mutual Defense Treaty. During the Vietnam War, the ROK Army and ROK Marines were among those fighting alongside South Vietnam and the United States.

        In the 1970s, through the Park Chung Hee Administration's "Yulgok Plan" (율곡사업), South Korea began to build up self-reliant, national defense capability.[7]
         The name derived from a scholar and a advisor to the king during the Joseon Dynasty. He had called out for an army of 10,000 men to keep the nation safe from any attacks.
          During South Korea's period of rapid growth in the 1980s, the military modernized, benefiting from several government-sponsored technology transfer projects and indigenous defense capability initiatives.
           In the 1990s, South Korean industries provided about 70 percent of the weapons, ammunition, communications and other types of equipment, vehicles, clothing, and other supplies needed by the military, and as of 2022, there are currently a total of 85 defense contractors in South Korea.[8]</p>
